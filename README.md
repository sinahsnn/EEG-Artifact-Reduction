# EEG-Artifact-Reduction
In this repository, some blind and semi-blind source separation methods, such as PCA, GEVD, ICA, and DSS, have been implemented to eliminate the EEG artifacts.
## Question 1  
- Ex1.mat data was scattered.
- the PCA algorithm was implemented on the data, and the principal components were extracted. Moreover, the whitened data was plotted. 
- PCA algorithm was implemented with the Matlab function, and the result was similar to the results obtained in the previous part.
- SVD decomposition was used, and checked the connections of PCA and SVD
## Question 2  
- Contains non-epileptic simulated data, which we contaminated with background EEG signal and muscle noise
- Extracted sources using PCA and Com2 (on of ICA algorithms) and eliminated undesirable sources
- Transferred the data to sensor space. Moreover, calculated RRMSE for the two methods.
