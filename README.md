# EEG-Artifact-Reduction
In this repository, some blind and semi-blind source separation methods, such as PCA, GEVD, ICA, and DSS, have been implemented to eliminate the EEG artifacts.
## Question 1  
- Ex1.mat data was scattered.
- the PCA algorithm was implemented on the data and the rincipal components were extracted. Moreover, the whitened data was plotted. 
- PCA algorithm was implemented with the matlab function and the result was similar with the results obtained in previous part.
- SVD decomposition was used and checked the connections of PCA and SVD
